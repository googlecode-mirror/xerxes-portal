			You have the option to run Xerxes together with Apache's mod_rewrite module or with one 
			 of the various mod_rewite-like ISAPI modules available for IIS. This option will
			 create simpler URLs for thing like the categories and databases pages, 'my saved records' and links sent
			 out when users email records to themselves. This is advantageous, since these URLs will likely 
			 be copied-and-pasted or otherwise used by users as stable links, and mod_rewrite will allow
			 for shorter and simpler URLs for that purpose. If you do not want to use Apache's mod_rewrite
			 module or choose not to install a URL rewriting ISAPI module in IIS, then set this value to false. 
			 If you are using rewrite true, you need to set up redirects in your webserver, see the
