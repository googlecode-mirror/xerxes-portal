Right, the difference between the two is that, a 'restricted' area will allow on-campus users to proceed without being prompted to login, while a 'login' area will prompt everyone to login, regardless of whether they are on-campus or not.
 
This gets a little fuzzy in that, if an on-campus user enters a restricted area (e.g., metasearch) Xerxes assigns them a temporary 'local' username, which then allows them to enter a 'login' area unchallenged.
 
That's actually by design.  
 
The only area that has @login=true is the folder area.  The idea here is that, if you arrive at the folder area directly from, say, the Xerxes home page or from a bookmark, you're most likely coming back to look at your previous saved records.  The system should then prompt you with a login screen so you can visit *your* saved record area.
 
If you arrive at the folder area by way of the metasearch section, however, it is likely because you have saved records from a search (even under the temporary username).  Many users just want to save and export without saving records long term -- something like half of all saved records are of this quick search-and-dump type -- so we don't force people to login to export the records.
 
If you are off-campus, of course, you have to login no matter what.
