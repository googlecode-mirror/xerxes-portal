#summary Configuration options

==alternate_fulltext_harvest_address==

The URL that Xerxes should point its SFX 'availability populate' action at, if different from link_resolver_address.  This is particularly useful if you you use a different front-end application to SFX -- e.g., Umlaut -- and have the link_resolver_address configured for that.

==alternate_yahoo_location==

Location of an alternate 'rela'y script for the Yahoo Spell Check API.  Since the Yahoo API has a daily limit based on IP address, this allows you to route some spell checking through another server in order to distribute the load.  This is particularly useful if you have multiple institutions hosted on the same server.

==application_name==

The 'name' of your Xerxes application.  By default, Xerxes only displays this in the browser title bar, as a prefix to each page name.  This can simply be the name of your university or library.

==application_sid==

The source identifier (sid) that Xerxes will include in each OpenURL.  This can be anything, really, and is useful for distinguishing Xerxes requests in SFX, both for display logic and statistical reasons.  Xerxes will also append the full name of the database to the sid.

==authentication_source==

The source against which you will authenticate users; valid values include:
     
  * *ldap* for a simple bind to an ldap-enabled directory server, including Active Directory
  * *innovative* for authentication against the Innovative Patron API
  * *cas* for authentication against a Central Authentication Source server
  * *demo* for a simple demo set-up when you don't want to configure a directory
  * *shibboleth* for Shibboleth authentication using a local configured shibd.
  * *custom* to use the script in demo/config/authentication/custom.php, where you can write your own authentication code
		
===authentication_source id=other===

Specify additional authentication_sources Xerxes can accept. Set 'id' to one of the authentication sources mentioned above.  You can send users to these alternate login pages by adding "&authentication_source=id" to the login page URL, changing 'id' to the value you entered here.

==base_web_path==

The base web server path for your Xerxes installation. DO NOT add a trailing slash. If you have installed at web root, leave this value empty. 

==cas_version==

The version of CAS you're running, either '1.0' or '2.0'.  If you are using a version higher than 2.0, just enter '2.0'.

==cas_login==

Full URL to the CAS login service.

==cas_validate==

Full URL to the CAS validate service.

==categories_quicksearch==

The 'normalized ID' of the category that should be used for the 'Quick Search' box on the Xerxes home page.  The normalized ID is a value that Xerxes constructs from the name of the category.  If you have Xerxes up and running, simply click on the category you want to use and look in the browser address bar.  The normalized ID is either the last part of the URL (if you have rewrite turned on) or is the value of '&subject=' if you do not.

==categories_num_columns==

The number of columns for the list of subjects on the home page. Enter either '2' or '3'. Useful if you are working in a smaller, fixed-width design, where two columns can allow for more readable text. If you want more columns, you'll need to customize the page itself.  

==database_connection==

The [http://us.php.net/manual/en/pdo.construct.php PDO connection string] to the database.  If you are using MySQL and called your database/schema 'xerxes', then the default value in config.xml is all you need.  If you called it something else, then change just the database name.

==database_list_searchable==

Setting this to 'true' will show a search box in the alphabetical database list, allowing users to search for databases by name or other descriptive information in the Metalib IRD.  Caution: users often mistakenly think that this searches the actual databases themselves (i.e., for articles and books), rather than merely a search of their descriptions.  This is off by default for a reason.  Consider whether you really need it.

==database_password==

The password of the account that is set-up to access the (MySQL) database.

==database_username==

The username of the account that is set-up to access the (MySQL) database.
