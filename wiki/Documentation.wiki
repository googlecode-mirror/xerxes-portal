#Other assorted useful documentation, not just for developers



= Availability Text =

You may have noticed that the links to "get" a record found in Xerxes sometimes do different things, and have different text. Here is the explanation of what the link text corresponds to. 

=== Link to resource discovered directly from resource via Metalib ===

1. Full-Text in HTML -- direct link to HTML
2. Full-Text in PDF -- direct link to PDF
3. Full-Text Available -- direct link, but format is unknown

=== Link to link resolver (SFX) ===

4. Full-Text Online -- Link to link resolver, but pre-check suggests link resolver will have it:

5. Check for availability -- Link to link resolver, availability unknown (but presumably there is no full-text otherwise link would have changed to the above--unless it's not an ISSN-bearing citation, in which case the pre-check often fails).

=== Display of links ===

If a link to a resource has been discovered directly from the resource, then that direct link will be provided on the results page, and no link resolver link will be provided. If no link to resource directly was discovered, then the results page has a link resolver link instead. 

The full record detail page will always have a link resolver link, but may also have one or more links direct to resource discovered directly from the resource.
