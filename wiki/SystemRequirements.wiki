#summary 1. Server requirements for setting-up Xerxes.

==PHP 5.1 or higher==

Xerxes also requires these PHP extensions:

 * pdo – for communication with the database
 * pdo_mysql – if you plan to use MySQL
 * xsl – for a number of tasks, including the interface
 * cli – command line interface for scheduling tasks via cron 

And will optionally require these PHP extensions:

 * ldap – if you plan to authenticate users against a directory server
 * openssl - if you plan to use CAS authentication
 * curl - if you need Xerxes to route all http traffic through an http proxy


==MySQL 5.0 or higher==

Right now, I only have SQL scripts to create the tables in MySQL 5.  The tables are straight forward and require no specific features of MySQL 5, so it should be simple to port the scripts to another RDBMS by simply changing some of the data types.

==Web Server==

You can pretty much run Xerxes on whatever web server you want, so long as it 
can support PHP.  People have successfully set it up using Apache 1.3, Apache 2.x and IIS 6 on both Windows and Linux servers.
