#summary Server requirements for setting-up Xerxes.

==PHP 5.1 or higher==

Xerxes also requires these PHP extensions:

 * pdo – for communication with the database
 * pdo_mysql – if you plan to use MySQL
 * xsl – for a number of tasks, including the interface
 * cli – command line interface for scheduling tasks via cron 

And will optionally require these PHP extensions:

 * ldap – if you plan to authenticate users against a directory server
 * openssl - if you plan to use CAS authentication


==MySQL 5.0 or higher==

Right now, I only have SQL scripts to create the tables in MySQL 5, although I 
have plans to support MySQL 4 and Oracle 10.  The tables are straight forward 
and require no specific features of MySQL 5, so it should be simple to port the 
scripts to another RDBMS by simply changing some of the data types.

==Web Server==

You can pretty much run Xerxes on whatever web server you want, so long as it 
can support PHP.  I've set it up on Apache 1.3, Apache 2.x and IIS 6 on both 
Windows and Linux servers.
